# Flight-Delay-Forecasting
This repository is part of Machine Learning [ML] course for first year master students at Innopolis University.

In this assignment, I am going to solve the task of flight delay estimation using machine learning, The goals are:
• Preprocess, visualize and split the dataset
• Estimating the flight delays by using Linear regression and Polynominal regression.
• Using Lasso which is a supervised regularization method to estimate flight delay.
• Comparing the performance of the previous models and analyzing the resuls.
